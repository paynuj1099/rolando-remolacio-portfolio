**Welcome to my first blog! This is a simple post stored as Markdown. I'll use this space to share tutorials, thoughts, experiences, and project updates.**
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually don’t know what to write, so please be kind to me. LOL.
This is my first time writing a blog, so I’m still learning, okay? HAHAHA.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I even make this portfolio? I already have one, actually, but I can’t take ownership of it because I got the source code on GitHub and just changed all the details and added some tweaks to the design. If you want to check it, here is the link: 
**<u><a href="https://rolandoremolacioje.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My 1st Portfolio</a></u>**.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I decided to build this personal portfolio from scratch—with a little help from AI—to really learn about good architecture and separation of concerns, since I’m still new to Next.js and TypeScript.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also took advantage of Claude Sonnet 4.5 to learn the best practices for Next.js and TS architecture. :) But the design, idea, and everything is from my experience and creativity. LOL, why am I explaining this haha.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if you might ask—why Next.js and TS? The answer is ...*Insert drumroll*... because it was my seniors’ recommendation. And I actually like it. It’s simple, and you can easily debug when using TS.
<br><br>
So that’s it for my first blog.
<br>

P.S. My dog is cute and her name is Phoebe. P.S.?? So Otits. LMAO<br><br>
