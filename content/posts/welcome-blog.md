**Welcome to my first blog! This is a simple post stored as Markdown. I'll use this space to share tutorials, thoughts, experiences, and project updates.**
<br><br>

Honestly, I’m not sure what to write yet, so please go easy on me. LOL. This is my first attempt at blogging, so I’m still figuring things out. HAHAHA.
<br><br>
You might be wondering why I made this portfolio. Well, I already had one, but I couldn’t really call it my own since I just grabbed the source code from GitHub, changed the details, and tweaked the design a bit. If you’re curious, here’s the link: **<u><a href="https://rolandoremolacioje.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My 1st Portfolio</a></u>**.
<br><br>
That’s why I decided to create this portfolio from scratch—with a little help from AI—so I could really learn about good architecture and separation of concerns, especially since I’m still new to Next.js and TypeScript.
<br><br>
I also made use of Claude Sonnet 4.5 to pick up best practices for Next.js and TS architecture. :) But the design, ideas, and everything else are from my own experience and creativity. LOL, why am I explaining all this haha.
<br><br>
If you’re wondering why I chose Next.js and TypeScript, the answer is...*Insert Drumroll*... because it was recommended by my seniors. And honestly, I like it! It’s simple and makes debugging much easier.
<br><br>

So that’s it for my first blog. Boring, right? LOL

P.S. My dog is adorable and her name is Phoebe. P.S.?? So Otits. LMAO
