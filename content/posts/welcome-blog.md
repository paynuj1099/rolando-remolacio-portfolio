**Welcome to my new blog! This is a simple post stored as Markdown. I use this space to share tutorials, thoughts, experiences, and project updates.**
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually don’t know what to write, so please be kind to me. LOL.
This is my first time writing a blog, so I’m still learning, okay?
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I do this portfolio? I already have one, actually, but I can’t take ownership of it because I got the source code on GitHub and just changed all the details and added some tweaks to the design.  
If you want to check it, here is the link: 
**<u><a href="https://rolandoremolacioje.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My 1st Portfolio</a></u>**.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s why I decided to create this personal portfolio of mine from scratch, but with the help of AI to actually build something scalable and to have good separation of concerns and architectural layout, since I’m still new to Next.js and TypeScript.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also took advantage of CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 to learn the best practices for Next.js and TS architecture. :) But the design, idea, and everything is from my experience and creativity. LOL, why am I explaining this haha.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if you might ask—why Next.js and TS? The answer is... *Insert drumroll*  because it was my seniors’ recommendation. And I actually like it. It’s simple, and you can easily debug when using TS.
<br><br>
So that’s it for my first blog.
<br>

P.S. My dog is cute and her name is Phoebe. <3 P.S.?? So Otits. HAHA<br><br>
